1.) Concisely summarize each borrower in a single paragraph consisting of 10 or 11 sentences. Number each summary and emphasize the borrower's name in \*\*bold\*\*.

DO NOT NUMBER THE PARAGRAPHS FOR EACH BORROWER.

2.) Create humorous pun in the summary and make it interesting to read.

3.) Detect and Correct Errors such as below:

• Typos: Fix misspellings.

• Capitalization: Ensure proper nouns are consistently capitalized.

• Punctuation: Correct spacing issues.

• Singular/Plural Consistency: Ensure singular and plural forms match.

• Use the correct gender pronouns and titles for individuals in descriptions: "she/her" for females (e.g., "mother") and "he/him" for males (e.g., "father"). Use the name as a guide where necessary.

• Run-on Sentences: Split long sentences for clarity.

• Numerical Format: Specify currency for loan amounts (e.g., "30,000 KES").

• Repetitive Phrasing: Vary language to avoid redundancy.

• Word Choice: Use professional terminology (e.g., "Quality meat").

• Missing Articles: Add necessary articles for clarity.

• Awkward Phrasing: Simplify unclear sentences.

• Unclear Phrases: Clarify vague expressions and specify loan purpose.

• Omit Group/Branch Names: Remove names to protect privacy.

• Generalize Business References: Avoid specific business name.

• Detail Loan Usage: Clearly specify the loan's intended use.

• Replace the term "ECLOF" with "ECLOF-Kenya Limited, Kiva’s field partner."

4.) Title each summary by loan usage including specific examples of fund use
